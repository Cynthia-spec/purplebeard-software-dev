hey Cynthia!

Great job!  

Let's get some pushing and pulling going.  You'll need to PULL this new
file down to your computer.  When you're ready, you'll need to PUSH your
next round of changes back up to the repo.

Let's do this a few times until you're comfortable with it!

Hi Adam!

Thank you!

Gradually getting to hang of things. 
I have been able to pull this new file onto my computer.
Now working on pushing it back to my repo.
